	abstract = {Unconstrained handwritten text recognition is one of the most difficult problems in the field of pattern recognition. Recently, a number of classifier creation and combination methods, known as ensemble methods, have been proposed in the field of machine learning. They have shown improved recognition performance over single classifiers. In this paper, we examine the influence of the vocabulary size, the number of training samples, and the number of classifiers on the performance of three ensemble methods in the context of cursive handwriting recognition. All experiments were conducted using an off-line handwritten word recognizer based on hidden Markov models (HMMs).},

@article{Holzinger2012,
	abstract = {Handwriting is an important modality for Human-Computer Interaction. For medical professionals, handwriting is (still) the preferred natural method of documentation. Handwriting recognition has long been a primary research area in Computer Science. With the tremendous ubiquity of smartphones, along with the renaissance of the stylus, handwriting recognition has become a new impetus. However, recognition rates are still not 100\% perfect, and researchers still are constantly improving handwriting algorithms. In this paper we evaluate the performance of entropy based slant- and skew-correction, and compare the results to other methods. We selected 3700 words of 23 writers out of the Unipen-ICROW-03 benchmark set, which we annotated with their associated error angles by hand. Our results show that the entropy-based slant correction method outperforms a window based approach with an average precision of $\pm$6.02$\,^{\circ}$ for the entropy-based method, compared with the $\pm$7.85$\,^{\circ}$ for the alternative. On the other hand, the entropy-based skew correction yields a lower average precision of $\pm$2:86$\,^{\circ}$, compared with the average precision of $\pm$2.13$\,^{\circ}$ for the alternative LSM based approach.},

  abstract = {{We have developed a near-real-time computer system that can locate and track a subject's head, and then recognize the person by comparing characteristics of the face to those of known individuals. The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as "eigenfaces," because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.}},
